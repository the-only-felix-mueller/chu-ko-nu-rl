## Bugs
- You can examine tiles beyond what you can see
- Enemies are always visible in explored areas
- You can shoot through walls


## Roadmap

- Enemies follow/charge the player
- Healthpoints for enemies and player
- Animated projetiles ('world' model/logic decides if the bolt misses, UI draws it)
- Animated floor tiles (flowing water, flickering torches?)
- Ammunition is consumed and can be picked up from the floor (How do I indicate when an entity stands on top of items? Blinking? Background-color?)
- "Shadow" of enemies is displayed where the player last saw them
- Different bolt types (fire, poison, knockback, durable, rope)
- Upgradeable crossbow (magazine size, accuracy, ...)
- Multiple levels
- Custom level generation
- Saving and loading (using localStorage)


## ToDo some time

- Make a better sidebar / interface
- Use nicer, square font
- Host a playable version of the game on github-pages.
- Address TODO's sprinkled around the code
- Thoroughly test movement system
- Mouse support

## Technical

- Map appearance to objects instead of arrays
