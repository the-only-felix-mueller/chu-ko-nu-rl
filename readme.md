# Chu-Ko-Nu RL


## Goals

This should eventually become a roguelike about a guy with a repeating crossbow, who finds bolts with different effects in a dungeon.

It's technically interesting because it has animated ascii graphics.

Some planned features can be seen in [plan.md](./plan.md).


## Building the game

1. Install npm, the Node Package Manager
2. `npm install`  -- Installs the libraries specified in package.json.
3. `npm run dev-build` -- Compiles the code using Webpack and tsc, the TypeScript compiler.
4. Open `./dist/index.html` in a web browser.
